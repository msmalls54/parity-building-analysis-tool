# Market Runway Dashboard

This standalone service turns a private Google Sheet into the working data
source for the React market-runway dashboard without giving Render access to
the Sheet. It is deployed separately from the building analyzer.

## How it works

1. An editor updates the five `Dashboard ...` tabs in the private Sheet.
2. The editor chooses **Dashboard -> Publish dashboard**.
3. The bound Apps Script validates the workbook, signs the exact JSON body with
   HMAC-SHA256, and sends it to the dedicated dashboard Render service.
4. The dashboard service validates the signature and business totals, writes
   an immutable version to its persistent disk, and atomically promotes it to
   `current.json`.
5. The password-protected `/market-runway` page loads the current version.

The public internet never receives a Sheet credential, the Sheet does not need
to be shared outside the Workspace, and an invalid update cannot replace the
last good version.

The browser bundle contains no fallback TAM figures. Until the first successful
Sheet publish, the dashboard shows a clear "no data published" state.

## Production configuration

- Render service: `parity-market-dashboard`, built with
  `Dockerfile.market-dashboard`.
- Dashboard password: `DASHBOARD_ACCESS_PASSWORD`.
- Session signing secret: `DASHBOARD_SESSION_SECRET`.
- Publisher secret: `MARKET_DASHBOARD_PUBLISH_SECRET` (at least 32 random
  characters).
- Persistent path: `MARKET_DASHBOARD_STORAGE_DIR`, configured as
  `/var/data/market_dashboard` on the dashboard service's own disk.
- Bound Sheet source: copy `apps_script/Code.gs` and `apps_script/appsscript.json`
  into an Apps Script project owned by the Sheet.
- The same publish secret must be stored in the bound script's Script
  Properties through **Dashboard -> Configure secure publishing**.

Dashboard viewers use a password and session that are independent of the
building analyzer. The publish endpoint is separate from browser login: it
requires a fresh timestamp, a one-use nonce, and a matching body signature.

## Updating and recovery

- Sheet changes are drafts until an editor explicitly publishes.
- Publishing identical data is idempotent and does not create noise.
- `/market-runway/versions` lists retained versions for authenticated viewers.
- `POST /market-runway/rollback/<version_id>` creates a new version pointing at
  the validated prior data; it does not erase history.

## Verification

Run the network-free checks:

```powershell
python -m unittest test_market_dashboard.py
python -m unittest test_market_dashboard_app.py
python -m compileall app_railway.py market_dashboard
```

Build the browser bundle:

```powershell
Set-Location market_dashboard/frontend
npm ci
npm run build
```
